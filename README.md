## History
I created this script originally for cheating on my exams. I had PDFs of the solutions and running this script, I could easily make docx files containg the whole PDF, which after printing were ready to be cut and made pocket notes. But I learned that no matter how advanced tools or techs I use, if I don't study well, my GPA would not be getting any better. I may hardly pass the exams using cheating papers, but getting a better CGPA really requires one to study well.
